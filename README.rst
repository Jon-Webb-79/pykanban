Installation
############
In order to download this repository from github, follow these TBD instructions

Contribute to Code Base
-----------------------
#. Establish a pull request with the git repository owner.

#. Once the package has been downloade, you will also need to install
   Python3.13 or later version to support documentation with Sphinx.

#. Navigate to the ``pykanban/`` directory.

#. Activate the virtual environment with the following command.

.. table:: Activation Commands for Virtual Environments

   +----------------------+------------------+-------------------------------------------+
   | Platform             | Shell            | Command to activate virtual environment   |
   +======================+==================+===========================================+
   | POSIX                | bash/zsh         | ``$ source <venv>/bin/activate``          |
   +                      +------------------+-------------------------------------------+
   |                      | fish             | ``$ source <venv>/bin/activate.fish``     |
   +                      +------------------+-------------------------------------------+
   |                      | csh/tcsh         | ``$ source <venv>/bin/activate.csh``      |

   +----------------------+------------------+-------------------------------------------+

#. Install packages to virtual environments from ``requirements.txt`` file

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install -r requirements.txt

#. At this point you can build the files in the same way described in the
   previous section and contribute to documentation.
